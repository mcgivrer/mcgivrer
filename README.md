## Who Am I ?

Hello dear visitor. Welcome to my virtual software home.

I am a former software developer, now acting as a platform architect in a world sized pharmaceutical life science industry (but this is topsecret and I won't tell you becasue I would have to make you "disapear" :)

Anyway, here is my personal playground around java (but not only !) software development, you will find some results from my own research about software architecture usage, pattern, tooling and librabries usages.
My center of interest are any tool/software that can drive to a better and well managed software, from ideation to production. 

I will try and use some BDD approach, good documentation principles (only personal point of view and experiment) and build automation with cloud offered platform like the github one.
