# McGivrer's Universe

## Who Am I?

Welcome to my virtual space dedicated to software development!  
I am a former software developer, now working as a platform architect in a global pharmaceutical industry (but hush, it's top secret ðŸ¤«).

Passionate about Java and many other technologies, I share my explorations here in software architecture, design patterns, and tools to better manage the software lifecycle, from ideation to production.

I experiment with approaches like [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development), and good documentation practices ([Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/)). You'll also find automation solutions using cloud-based platforms like GitHub.
