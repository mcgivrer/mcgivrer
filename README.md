## Who Am I ?

Hello dear visitor. Welcome to my virtual software home.

<img alt="McGivrer's outdoor photo" src="./images/mcgivrer-avatar-2021.jpg" title="McGivrer !" align="left"/>I am a former software developer, now acting as a platform architect in a world sized pharmaceutical life science industry (but this is topsecret and I won't tell you becasue I would have to make you "disapear" :) 

<img alt="Red: create test, Green: Code passing test, Refactor: clean code" src="./images/RGR-Mantra.png" title="The RGR Mantra" align="right" width="200px"/>Anyway, here is my personal playground around java (but not only !) software development, you will find some results from my own research about software architecture usage, pattern, tooling and librabries usages.
My center of interest are any tool/software that can drive to a better and well managed software, from ideation to production. 

I will try and use some [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development "Go to the TDD wikipedia description") approach, maybe [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development "Go to the BDD wikipedia description"), but moreover, [good documentation principles](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/ "Write the docs !") (only personal point of view and experiment) and build automation with cloud offered platform like the github one.

- **NEW 2022-05-20** [A v4.1 script to build light java project](https://gist.github.com/mcgivrer/a31510019029eba73edf5721a93c3dec#file-readme-md), havining already the javadoc generation and unit test exection thanks to the "junit platform console standalone", now it is able to create an EPUB file from the /docs markdown documentation files, respecting a file and directory structure and thanks to the fantastic tool [pandoc](https://pandoc.org "Let's have a try with pandoc !"),

> **WARNING** 
> This build script does not intends to replace a really more efficient and useful [maven](https://maven.apache.org/ "don't you already know maven ?  time to discover the most industrial way to build java project") or [gradle](https://gradle.org "the latest but not least build tool for java ecosystem, supporting the Android ecosystem and more !") tool. 
> It's purpose is only to provide a fast way and an ease of usage to build ridiculous small java project.
> But without sacrifying build features.
